Tesseract is still in the early stage of development, we expect only a handful of collaborators with individual roles.

__Rules for collaborating:__
1. To avoid duplicating work, please contact us *before* you write any code:
  * Report bugs and propose new features via issues. We don't have templates at this point;
  * If you decide to implement a feature or fix a bug, leave a comment in the appropriate issue or create a new one;
2. The codebase must follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). We recommend using pycharm builtin linter;
3. We encourage everyone to follow [Contributor Convent v2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) in their communication.


### Tips & tricks
* You can find a wealth of pytorch debugging tricks at [their contributing page](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Tesseract is optimized for development in pycharm CE 2019.3 or newer.
  * When working on tests, please mark "tests" as sources root.
